# CyanPrint Developer Overview

This section provides an overview of CyanPrint from a developer's perspective. As a developer, you can contribute to the CyanPrint ecosystem by creating templates, processors, and plugins.

## What Can You Develop?

CyanPrint supports three types of artifacts that developers can create:

- **Templates**: Blueprints for creating new projects with customizable options
- **Processors**: Components that transform template files based on user inputs
- **Plugins**: Extensions that perform additional actions after project generation

## Key Features for Developers

- **Language Agnostic**: Develop templates, processors, and plugins in any programming language
- **Docker-Based**: Package your artifacts as Docker images for easy distribution
- **Centralized Registry**: Publish your artifacts to the CyanPrint registry for others to discover
- **Extensible Architecture**: Build on top of the CyanPrint platform with custom functionality
