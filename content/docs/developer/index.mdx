As a CyanPrint developer, you can develop CyanPrint artifacts, such as templates, plugins, and processors.


# CyanPrint Artifacts
There are 3 main CyanPrint artifacts:

### Templates
Templates are the main artifact of CyanPrint. They are the blueprints for creating new projects.

### Processors
Processors are used to process templates. They can be used to add new rules on processing templates, such as
variables substitution, loops or flags.

Commonly, processors can wrap existing templating engines that exist like go templates, jinja, ejs or handlebars.

### Plugins
Plugins are used to extend the functionality of Templates. Plugins perform additional actions after templates
are created. Examples of plugins would be running dependency installation or pushing the project to a git repository.

# Pre-requisites
To develop CyanPrint artifacts, you need to have the following installed:
- Docker
- CyanPrint CLI
- [CyanPrint Account](https://cyanprint.dev)
- Language of your choice to develop.

Currently, the officially supported languages are:
- C#
