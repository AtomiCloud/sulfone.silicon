# CyanPrint Overview

CyanPrint is a language-agnostic scaffolding platform designed to unify project scaffolding across different programming ecosystems. It addresses the limitations of traditional templating engines by providing a flexible and extensible solution that works with any programming language.

This section provides an overview of CyanPrint from a user's perspective, covering its key features, benefits, and how it differs from traditional scaffolding tools.

## Key Features

- **Language Agnostic**: Use templates from any programming ecosystem without installing their runtimes
- **Zero-Dependency Experience**: Minimal CLI installation with no runtime dependencies
- **Centralized Registry**: Discover and share templates through a central registry
- **Rich Interactive Experience**: User-friendly prompts and intuitive workflow
- **Extensibility**: Support for processors and plugins to enhance template functionality

## What is CyanPrint?

CyanPrint is a next-generation templating platform that allows you to quickly create new projects from predefined templates. Unlike traditional templating engines that are tied to specific programming languages, CyanPrint works with any language and requires minimal setup.

With CyanPrint, you can:
- Create new projects from templates with a simple command
- Customize your projects through an interactive prompting system
- Access a wide range of templates from the central registry
- Extend functionality through processors and plugins

## Why Use CyanPrint?

Modern software development involves navigating complex ecosystems of tools, libraries, and frameworks. Setting up a new project often takes days rather than hours, especially when adhering to methodologies like the 12-Factor App, containerization, and infrastructure as code.

CyanPrint addresses these challenges by:
- Automating boilerplate code generation
- Ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices
- Improving maintainability and scalability
- Facilitating knowledge sharing through templates

## How CyanPrint Differs

Unlike traditional templating engines like CookieCutter (Python), Yeoman (JavaScript), or Copier (Python), CyanPrint:
- Doesn't require specific runtimes (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- Provides a centralized registry for discovering templates
- Offers a user-friendly interface similar to Create React App
- Supports templates written in any language
