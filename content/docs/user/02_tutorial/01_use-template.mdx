# Using a CyanPrint Template

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a new project using a CyanPrint template.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [Installed CyanPrint](/docs/user/tutorial/00_installation) on your system
- Internet connection to access the CyanPrint registry

## Creating a New Project

### Basic Usage

To create a new project using a template, use the `cyan new` command followed by the template name:

```bash
cyan new template-name
```

This will:
1. Download the specified template from the registry
2. Run the template's interactive prompts
3. Generate your project based on your answers

### Example: Creating a React Application

Let's create a simple React application using the `react-app` template:

```bash
cyan new react-app my-react-app
```

<Callout type="info">
  The second argument (`my-react-app`) is optional and specifies the directory name for your new project. If omitted, CyanPrint will ask you for a project name during the interactive prompts.
</Callout>

### Interactive Prompts

After running the command, CyanPrint will guide you through a series of questions to customize your project:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Project Name**
    
    If you didn't specify a project name in the command, you'll be asked to provide one.
    
    ```
    ? Project name: my-react-app
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Template-specific Questions**
    
    Each template has its own set of questions. For a React application, you might be asked about:
    
    ```
    ? Package manager (Use arrow keys)
      ❯ npm
        yarn
        pnpm
    
    ? Include TypeScript? (y/N)
    
    ? Include testing framework? (y/N)
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Confirmation**
    
    Review your choices and confirm to proceed with project generation.
    
    ```
    ? Generate project with these settings? (Y/n)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Project Generation

Once you've answered all the questions, CyanPrint will:

1. Process the template with your answers
2. Generate the project files
3. Run any post-generation plugins (if applicable)

You'll see output similar to:

```
✓ Downloading template: react-app
✓ Processing template
✓ Generating files
✓ Running plugins
✓ Project created successfully!

Your new project is ready at: /path/to/my-react-app
```

## Next Steps

After creating your project:

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-react-app
   ```

2. Follow any post-generation instructions provided by the template

3. Start developing your application!
