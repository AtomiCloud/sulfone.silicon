# Install Specific CyanPrint Version

This recipe shows you how to install a specific version of the CyanPrint CLI instead of the latest version.

## Why Install a Specific Version?

You might want to install a specific version of CyanPrint for:

- Compatibility with certain templates
- Consistency across a team or project
- Testing or debugging purposes
- Avoiding potential issues with newer versions

## Using Package Managers

### Homebrew

To install a specific version using Homebrew:

```bash
# List available versions
brew tap atomicloud/tap
brew info atomicloud/tap/cyan

# Install a specific version
brew install atomicloud/tap/cyan@1.2.3
```

<Callout type="info">
  Replace `1.2.3` with the actual version number you want to install.
</Callout>

## Direct Download

You can download a specific version directly from GitHub:

  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Extract and Install**
    
    Extract the package and move the binary to a location in your PATH:

    chmod +x ./cyan
    sudo mv ./cyan /usr/local/bin/
    ```

brew link cyan@1.2.3
```

### Using Direct Download
