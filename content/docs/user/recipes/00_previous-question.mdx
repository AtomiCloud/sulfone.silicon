# Go to Previous Question

When using CyanPrint templates, you might need to go back to a previous question to change your answer. This recipe shows you how to navigate back during the interactive prompting phase.

## Using Keyboard Navigation

During template execution, you can navigate to previous questions using keyboard shortcuts:

1. Press the **Up Arrow** key to move to the previous question
2. Press the **Down Arrow** key to move back to where you were

<Callout type="info">
  You can navigate through multiple questions by pressing the Up Arrow key multiple times.
</Callout>

## Using the "back" Command

You can also type `back` at any prompt to return to the previous question:

```
? Select a package manager: back
```

This will take you back to the previous question in the sequence.

## Example Workflow

Here's an example of navigating back during template execution:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Project Name Question**
    
    ```
    ? Project name: my-project
    ```
    
    You enter "my-project" and press Enter.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Package Manager Question**
    
    ```
    ? Package manager: npm
    ```
    
    You select "npm" and press Enter.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **TypeScript Question**
    
    ```
    ? Use TypeScript? Yes
    ```
    
    You select "Yes" and press Enter.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Going Back**
    
    At the next question, you realize you want to change your package manager choice.
    
    ```
    ? Include testing framework? back
    ```
    
    You type "back" and press Enter.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Changing Your Answer**
    
    ```
    ? Use TypeScript? back
    ```
    
    You type "back" again to go back to the package manager question.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Updating Your Choice**
    
    ```
    ? Package manager: yarn
    ```
    
    You select "yarn" instead of "npm" and continue with the template.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Limitations

- You can only navigate back through questions that have already been asked
- Some templates may have dependencies between questions, so changing an earlier answer might reset subsequent questions
- You cannot skip ahead to questions that haven't been asked yet
