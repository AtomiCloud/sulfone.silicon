# Install Template and Create Folder

This recipe shows you how to install a CyanPrint template and create a new folder for your project in a single command.

## Basic Usage

To install a template and create a new folder for your project, use the `cyan new` command followed by the template name and the folder name:

```bash
cyan new template-name project-folder
```

This command:
1. Creates a new directory named `project-folder` in your current location
2. Downloads the specified template from the registry
3. Runs the template's interactive prompts
4. Generates your project in the new directory

<Callout type="info">
  The folder name argument is optional. If you don't provide it, CyanPrint will ask you for a project name during the interactive prompts.
</Callout>

## Example

Let's create a new React application in a folder named "my-react-app":

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Navigate to your desired parent directory**
    
    ```bash
    cd ~/projects
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Run the CyanPrint command**
    
    ```bash
    cyan new react-app my-react-app
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Answer the template questions**
    
    Complete the interactive prompts to customize your project.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Navigate to your new project**
    
    ```bash
    cd my-react-app
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Specifying a Path

You can also specify a path for the new folder:

```bash
cyan new react-app ~/projects/my-react-app
```

This creates the project at the specified path, creating any necessary parent directories.

## Handling Existing Directories

If the specified directory already exists:

- If the directory is empty, CyanPrint will use it for the new project
- If the directory is not empty, CyanPrint will prompt you to confirm before proceeding

<Callout type="warning">
  Be careful when using an existing directory, as CyanPrint may overwrite files with the same names as those generated by the template.
</Callout>
