# Install Template in Current Folder

This recipe shows you how to install a CyanPrint template in your current directory instead of creating a new folder.

## Basic Usage

To install a template in your current directory, use the `cyan new` command with the `--here` flag:

```bash
cyan new template-name --here
```

This command:
1. Downloads the specified template from the registry
2. Runs the template's interactive prompts
3. Generates your project in the current directory

<Callout type="warning">
  Be careful when using this option in a directory that already contains files. CyanPrint may overwrite files with the same names as those generated by the template.
</Callout>

## Example

Let's create a new React application in your current directory:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Create an empty directory (optional)**
    
    If you want to start with a clean directory:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir my-project
    cd my-project
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Run the CyanPrint command**
    
    ```bash
    cyan new react-app --here
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Answer the template questions**
    
    Complete the interactive prompts to customize your project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using with Non-Empty Directories

When using the `--here` flag in a directory that already contains files:

1. CyanPrint will warn you that the directory is not empty
2. You'll be asked to confirm before proceeding
3. If you confirm, CyanPrint will generate files in the current directory, potentially overwriting existing files

<Callout type="tip">
  It's a good practice to commit any existing work to version control before using this option, so you can revert if needed.
</Callout>

## Combining with Other Options

You can combine the `--here` flag with other options:

```bash
# Use a specific version of the template
cyan new react-app@1.2.3 --here

# Skip confirmation prompts
cyan new react-app --here --yes
```
