# Run Specific Template Version

This recipe shows you how to use a specific version of a CyanPrint template instead of the latest version.

## Why Use a Specific Version?

You might want to use a specific template version for:

- Consistency across a team or project
- Compatibility with existing projects
- Avoiding potential issues with newer versions
- Following specific documentation or tutorials

## Specifying a Version

To use a specific version of a template, append the version number to the template name with an `@` symbol:

```bash
cyan new template-name@1.2.3
```

This command:
1. Checks if the specified version exists in the registry
2. Downloads that specific version
3. Runs the template as normal

<Callout type="info">
  Replace `1.2.3` with the actual version number you want to use.
</Callout>

## Example

Let's create a new React application using version 2.1.0 of the react-app template:

```bash
cyan new react-app@2.1.0 my-react-app
```

## Viewing Available Versions

To see what versions are available for a template:

```bash
cyan info react-app --versions
```

This will display a list of all available versions for the template, along with their release dates and change notes.

## Using Version Ranges

CyanPrint also supports semantic versioning ranges:

```bash
# Use the latest 1.x.x version
cyan new react-app@^1.0.0

# Use the latest 2.3.x version
cyan new react-app@~2.3.0
```

<Callout type="tip">
  Using version ranges can be helpful when you want to get bug fixes but avoid major changes.
</Callout>

## Combining with Other Options

You can combine version specification with other options:

```bash
# Use a specific version in the current directory
cyan new react-app@1.2.3 --here

# Use a specific version and create a new folder
cyan new react-app@1.2.3 my-project
```
