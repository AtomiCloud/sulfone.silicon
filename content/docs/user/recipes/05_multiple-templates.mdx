# Using Multiple Templates

This recipe shows you how to combine multiple CyanPrint templates in a single project.

## Why Use Multiple Templates?

You might want to use multiple templates when:

- Building a complex project with different components
- Adding specific functionality to an existing project
- Combining frontend and backend templates
- Extending a project with additional features

## Sequential Template Application

The most common way to use multiple templates is to apply them sequentially:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Create the base project with the first template**
    
    ```bash
    cyan new base-template my-project
    ```
    
    This creates your initial project structure.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Navigate to the project directory**
    
    ```bash
    cd my-project
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Apply additional templates**
    
    ```bash
    cyan new additional-template --here
    ```
    
    The `--here` flag tells CyanPrint to apply the template to the current directory.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  When applying multiple templates, be careful about potential conflicts. Templates might try to create or modify the same files.
</Callout>

## Example: Creating a Full-Stack Application

Let's create a full-stack application by combining a backend API template with a frontend React template:

```bash
# Create the base project with the backend template
cyan new node-express-api my-fullstack-app

# Navigate to the project directory
cd my-fullstack-app

# Apply the frontend template
cyan new react-app --here --target frontend

# The --target option (if supported by the template) specifies
# where to generate the frontend files
```

## Using Template Composition

Some templates are designed to work together through composition. These templates are aware of each other and can integrate seamlessly:

```bash
# Create a project with composed templates
cyan new fullstack-app --with auth-module,database-module
```

<Callout type="info">
  Template composition is a more advanced feature and depends on templates being designed to work together. Not all templates support composition.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

When working with multiple templates:

1. **Apply templates in the right order**: Start with the most fundamental template and add more specific ones later.

2. **Use version control**: Commit your changes after applying each template to track changes and revert if needed.

3. **Resolve conflicts carefully**: When templates conflict, carefully review the changes to ensure the correct functionality is preserved.

4. **Use template options**: Many templates provide options to customize their behavior, which can help avoid conflicts.

5. **Consider custom directories**: Apply templates to subdirectories when appropriate to keep components separate.
