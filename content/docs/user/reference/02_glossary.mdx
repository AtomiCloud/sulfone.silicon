# CyanPrint Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the CyanPrint documentation.

## A

### Answer
The user's response to a question asked by a template during the question phase.

### Argon
The frontend component of the CyanPrint registry, providing a web interface for browsing and discovering templates.

## B

### Blob
A simple file or collection of files without processing capabilities, as opposed to a template which has interactive and processing capabilities.

### Boron
The coordinator component of CyanPrint that orchestrates the execution of templates, processors, and plugins.

## C

### CLI (Command-Line Interface)
The primary way users interact with CyanPrint through terminal commands.

### Coordinator
The service that manages the execution environment for templates, processors, and plugins, ensuring security and reliability.

### CyanPrint
A next-generation language-agnostic templating platform that enables users to create new projects from predefined templates with customizable options.

## D

### Determinism
The property of a template to produce the same output given the same inputs, regardless of when or where it is run.

## G

### Generation Phase
The phase in which CyanPrint creates the project directory structure and writes all processed files to disk.

## H

### Helium
The SDK for developing templates, processors, and plugins for CyanPrint, supporting multiple programming languages.

## I

### IInquier
The interface used by templates to define and present questions to users during the question phase.

### Iridium
The Rust-based CLI tool for CyanPrint that users interact with to create projects from templates.

## P

### Phase
A distinct stage in the CyanPrint workflow, including template discovery, question phase, processing phase, generation phase, and plugin phase.

### Plugin
A component that extends CyanPrint functionality by performing post-generation actions such as installing dependencies or initializing version control.

### Plugin Phase
The final phase in the CyanPrint workflow where plugins run to perform post-generation actions.

### Processor
A component that defines rules for transforming template files based on user inputs, such as modifying file contents or renaming files.

### Processing Phase
The phase in which CyanPrint applies user answers to the template and executes processors to transform template files.

## Q

### Question Phase
The phase in which CyanPrint presents interactive prompts to the user and collects their answers.

## R

### Registry
The central repository where templates, processors, and plugins are stored and distributed.

## S

### Silicon
The documentation component of CyanPrint, providing comprehensive guides for users, developers, and contributors.

## T

### Template
A blueprint for creating new projects in CyanPrint, consisting of files, questions, and processing logic.

### Template Discovery
The initial phase in the CyanPrint workflow where the requested template is found and downloaded.

### Template Upgrades
The process of updating a project to use a newer version of the template it was created from.

## Z

### Zinc
The backend component of the CyanPrint registry, managing component metadata and files.
