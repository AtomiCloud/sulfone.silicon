# Searching the Registry

This tutorial will guide you through the process of searching for templates in the CyanPrint registry.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [Installed CyanPrint](/docs/user/tutorial/00_installation) on your system
- Internet connection to access the CyanPrint registry

## Basic Search

To search for templates in the registry, use the `cyan search` command:

```bash
cyan search
```

This will list all available templates in the registry.

## Filtering Search Results

You can filter search results by providing a search term:

```bash
cyan search react
```

This will return all templates that have "react" in their name or description.

## Viewing Template Details

To view detailed information about a specific template, use the `cyan info` command followed by the template name:

```bash
cyan info react-app
```

This will display:

- Template name and version
- Author information
- Description
- Tags
- Dependencies
- Usage instructions

<Callout type="info">
  The `cyan info` command is useful for learning more about a template before using it to create a project.
</Callout>

## Example: Finding a Node.js Template

Let's say you want to find a template for creating a Node.js application:

```bash
cyan search node
```

This might return results like:

```
Found 3 templates:

1. node-express-api
   A template for creating Express.js API applications
   Author: cyanprint-team
   Tags: node, express, api

2. node-cli
   A template for creating Node.js command-line applications
   Author: cyanprint-team
   Tags: node, cli

3. node-typescript
   A template for creating Node.js applications with TypeScript
   Author: community-user
   Tags: node, typescript
```

You can then view more details about a specific template:

```bash
cyan info node-express-api
```
