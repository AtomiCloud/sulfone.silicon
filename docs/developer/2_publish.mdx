# Publishing

After authoring your own templates, processors or plugins, you can publish it to the CyanPrint registry.


### Template

To publish a template, you need to create a `cyan.yaml` file in the root of your project. This file should contain the following information:

```json
{
  "name": "my-template",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "My template",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "license": "MIT",
  "cyanprint": {
    "type": "template"
  }
}
```

Then, you can publish your template by running the following command:

```bash

```
