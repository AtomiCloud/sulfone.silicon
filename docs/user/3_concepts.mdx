# Key Concepts

This document explains the core concepts and terminology used in CyanPrint.

## Templates

Templates are the foundation of CyanPrint. A template is a collection of files, directories, and configuration that defines how a project should be generated. Templates can include:

- Skeleton files and directories
- Variables for customization
- Plugins for post-generation tasks
- Processors for advanced templating

### Template Structure

A typical template has the following structure:

```
my-template/
├── cyan.yaml           # Template configuration
├── template/           # Template files
│   ├── src/
│   ├── scripts/
│   └── ...
├── plugins/            # Optional plugins
└── processors/         # Optional processors
```

The `cyan.yaml` file defines the template's metadata, variables, and configuration:

```yaml
name: my-template
version: 1.0.0
description: A template for creating a new project
author: Your Name
variables:
  - name: projectName
    type: string
    prompt: What is your project name?
  - name: includeTests
    type: boolean
    prompt: Include tests?
```

## Processors

Processors are components that transform template files before they are written to the output directory. They enable advanced templating features like:

- Variable substitution
- Conditional inclusion of files
- Looping and other control flow
- Template inheritance

CyanPrint supports various processor types, including:

- Handlebars
- EJS
- Jinja
- Go Templates
- Custom processors

## Plugins

Plugins extend CyanPrint's functionality by performing additional actions after a template is generated. Common plugin use cases include:

- Installing dependencies
- Initializing a git repository
- Running build scripts
- Setting up CI/CD
- Creating databases or other resources

Plugins can be bundled with templates or installed separately.

## Registry

The CyanPrint Registry is a central repository for discovering and sharing templates. Key features include:

- Template hosting and versioning
- Search and discovery
- User accounts and organizations
- Access control
- Usage statistics

## Coordinator

The Coordinator is responsible for executing templates and orchestrating the generation process. It:

1. Resolves template dependencies
2. Collects variable values from the user
3. Applies processors to template files
4. Runs plugins
5. Handles error recovery and reporting

## Variables and Prompts

Templates can define variables that are collected from the user during the generation process. Variables can be:

- Simple types (string, number, boolean)
- Complex types (objects, arrays)
- Derived from other variables
- Validated with rules

Variables can be collected through:

- Interactive prompts
- Command-line arguments
- Configuration files
- Environment variables

## Non-Interactive Mode

CyanPrint supports both interactive and non-interactive modes:

- **Interactive Mode**: Prompts the user for input
- **Non-Interactive Mode**: Uses predefined values without user interaction

Non-interactive mode is useful for automation and CI/CD pipelines.

## Template Development

CyanPrint provides SDKs for developing templates in various languages:

- .NET
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Python

These SDKs include:

- API clients for the Registry and Coordinator
- Helper functions for creating and testing templates
- Types and interfaces for working with CyanPrint

## Local Templates

Besides using templates from the Registry, you can also use local templates directly from your filesystem:

```bash
cyanprint run ./my-template --output ./my-project
```

This is useful during template development or for private templates that are not published to the Registry.
